Prompt

Design a circuit which generates the Fibonacci sequence starting with 1 and 1 as the first two numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two previous numbers. More formally this can be expressed as:

F0 = 1
F1 = 1
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for n > 1.

Following the definition of the Fibonacci sequence above we can see that the 
sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.

The sequence should be produced when the active low signal (resetn) becomes 
active. In other words, the sequence should restart from 1 followed by another 
1 (the Fibonacci sequence's initial condition) as soon as resetn becomes active.
Input and Output Signals

    clk - Clock signal
    resetn - Synchronous reset-low signal
    out - Current Fibonacci number

Output signals during reset

    out - 1 when resetn is active (the first 1 of the Fibonacci sequence)

Example (Click to Expand)

First six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, followed by the first five 
numbers of Fibonacci sequence after a reset occurs.

Note that the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are always 1 and 1.
